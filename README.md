# Strategy Backtrader 
## About:

Using the Backtrader library, I developed a tool that would allow me to code a strategy and then test it against a given set of data over a set period of time.
This tool also provides key information to the user such as the max drawdown and the sharpe ratio. I decided to develop this tool in order to gain insight into the world of algorithmic
trading and managing/hedging risk.


## Usage: 

~~~
python .\Backtrading.py MACD "Ticker 1" 

or

python .\Backtrading.py Pairs "Ticker 1" "Ticker 2"
~~~
