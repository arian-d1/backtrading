# Strategy Backtrader 
## About:

Using the Backtrader library, I developed a tool that would allow me to code a strategy and then test it against a given set of data over a set period of time.
This tool also provides key information to the user such as the max drawdown and the sharpe ratio. I decided to develop this tool in order to gain insight into the world of algorithmic
trading and managing/hedging risk.
